Data Structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, and storing data. They are essential for efficient data management and manipulation. Some common types of data structures include:

Arrays: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
Linked Lists: A sequential collection of elements where each element points to the next.
Stacks: A collection that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Queues: A collection that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Trees: A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to child nodes.

Implementing DSA concepts in this repository serves as both a practical learning tool and a valuable resource for others. As Padmesh, I am uploading these concepts through various implementations to help beginners grasp the fundamentals and assist experienced developers in refining their skills. This repository aims to provide invaluable insights into the core principles of computer science. By exploring these implementations, users can gain a deeper understanding of how data is handled and processed, ultimately leading to better software design and optimization.
